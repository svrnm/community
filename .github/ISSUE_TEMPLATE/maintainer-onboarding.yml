      Unless stated otherwise in a SIG charter ratified by the Technical Committee, all existing maintainers are asked to vote, 
      if the candidate should be added to their group of maintainers. They vote by commenting "I support" or "I do not support" on this issue.
      The election is over, when a majority of the maintainers have voted. If the majority have voted in favour of the candidate, the candidate 
      can accept (or decline) the vote by commenting "I accept" or "I decline". If the candidate has not been elected, the issue can be closed.
    options:
      - label: Has the candidate been elected?
      - label: Has the candidate accepted?
